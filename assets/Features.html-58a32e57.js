After successfully solving this problem, I added some features and modified some content, so I released my version and named it Town Of Host Edited.</p><p>The purpose of this mod is to allow me to learn some new knowledge, so it may be discontinued after I finish my studies or quit the game.</p><p>This is my first time using C#, so TOHE&#39;s code was terrible and there were a lot of bugs. Later, as the versions were updated one by one, after three complete rewrites, I am now gradually proficient in development. Even if there is no one who can assist me in development, maybe the development efficiency is very low, and the update can only be done day and night, but at least TOHE does not have a big technical bottleneck at present.</p><p>In short, I am very happy that you can support my learning results! If possible, post more videos of TOHE on the video platform, I will be really happy.</p><h2 id="feedback-contact" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#feedback-contact" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Feedback &amp; Contact</h2><p align="left"><a href="https://discord.gg/5PNwUaN5" target="_blank"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Discord -%231DA1F2.svg?&amp;style=for-the-badge&amp;logo=discord&amp;logoColor=white&amp;color=5662f6"></a>  <a href="https://github.com/KARPED1EM/TownOfHostEdited" target="_blank"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Github -%231DA1F2.svg?&amp;style=for-the-badge&amp;logo=github&amp;logoColor=white&amp;color=181717"></a></p>',7);function k(E,A){const t=s("ExternalLinkIcon");return i(),l("div",null,[d,e("p",null,[e("a",c,[p,n(t)]),o("：Creator of TOHE")]),e("p",null,[e("a",m,[g,n(t)]),o("：Art")]),e("p",null,[e("a",f,[o("NCSIMON"),n(t)]),o("：Role Coding")]),e("p",null,[e("a",u,[o("Tommy-XL"),n(t)]),o("：English & Russian Translator")]),e("p",null,[e("a",b,[_,n(t)]),o("：Role Coding & Tech Support")]),e("p",null,[e("a",y,[C,n(t)]),o("：Role Coding & Features Coding")]),e("p",null,[e("a",v,[o("喜"),n(t)]),o("：Role Coding")]),e("p",null,[e("a",w,[o("SHAAARKY"),n(t)]),o("：Role Coding")]),I])}const R=a(h,[["render",k],["__file","Features.html.vue"]]);export{R as default};

So for players who don&#39;t have the mod installed, you will see that you are an Impostor with no teammates. Please refer to the name on your head.</p><h2 id="what-are-the-host-only-mods" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#what-are-the-host-only-mods" aria-hidden="true">#</a> What are the Host-only mods</h2><p>H refers to Host, which is a mod that is compatible with the original version. It only needs to be installed by the host, and other players can play without installing the mod. In order to be compatible with the original version, the H-series mods have many functions and roles that cannot be realized. Even if they are realized, the way of realization is very strange. For example, the sheriff is shown as a Impostor, and the instructions of gambling monsters cannot be hidden.</p><h2 id="the-game-ends-inexplicably" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#the-game-ends-inexplicably" aria-hidden="true">#</a> The game ends inexplicably</h2><p>Game ends suddenly, If there are still imps alive and the victory conditions of the neutrals are not met.

When the bug occurs in the original TOH, the homeowner will not be able to see the start button, and other players will be loaded with an infinite black screen. In this case, everyone can only exit the game. In TOHE, in order to avoid this situation, it will automatically detect whether other players are stuck in loading, and if detected, the game will be automatically terminated to prevent everyone from being stuck. So it&#39;s a protection mechanism, just ignore it and keep playing.</p><h2 id="most-of-the-screen-is-black-but-the-sound-can-be-heard-and-there-is-a-setting-button" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#most-of-the-screen-is-black-but-the-sound-can-be-heard-and-there-is-a-setting-button" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Most of the screen is black, but the sound can be heard and there is a setting button</h2><p>A situation that may suddenly appear at the beginning or during the game.

If yes, please exit the game and check if there is an update button in the lower left corner of the main menu, if not, please restart the game and check if there is a update button again.
